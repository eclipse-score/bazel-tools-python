# Rule compile_pip_requirements handles pip requirements.
# It has two important targets:
#  - requirements.update: A runnable target that updates the lock file
#  - requirements_test: A test target that validates the lock file
#
# To run the update script in Windows, make sure your user or system .bazelrc has the
# following set:
#   startup --windows_enable_symlinks
#   build --enable_runfiles
# This is necessary until `rules_python` is updated to 1.0.0, which fixes it.
# Check https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_python/issues/1431
