## Known Vulnerabilities

Known vulnerabilities may vary according to the selected Python version.

You can check our latest constraints against vulnerable package versions in our [requirements.in file](third_party/pip/requirements.in).

The following table lists all known vulnerabilities that could not be fixed:

| Package    | Vulnerability ID    | Vulnerable Version | Fixed Version | Python Version | Reason                               |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| urllib3    | GHSA-48p4-8xcf-vxj5 | 2.2.3              | 2.5.0         | 3.8            | Fixed package requires Python >= 3.9 |
| urllib3    | GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v | 2.2.3              | 2.5.0         | 3.8            | Fixed package requires Python >= 3.9 |
| pip        | GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph | 25.0.1             | 25.3          | 3.8            | Fixed package requires Python >= 3.9 |

### Vulnerable Python Versions

The [official status of Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) shows which Python versions are no longer supported and therefore are vulnerable.

While we might support some vulnerable Python versions for backwards compatibility, we strongly advise our users to consider upgrading to a more recent version.
